# Hackthon-Project
This is a robotic arm project our team made at Citrus Hack@UCR. The robotic arm is basically controlled by a Wii nunchuck via Arduino board. Here's the code we made to control each servo that robotic arm has (there are five total). 
The finished project can follow movements that the nunchuck does(including left, right, up, down, forward and backward), the joystick controls the motions of the arm's wrist, and the c/z buttons control the claw to pick up objects.
